# TODO List for Spark NYC Taxi Rides Analysis

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Dataset Operations
- [ ] Convert DataFrames to Datasets
- [ ] Demonstrate Dataset transformations (e.g., map, flatMap, filter, etc.)
- [ ] Perform Dataset actions (e.g., collect, groupByKey, reduceByKey)

### 2. Low-level API (RDD) Operations
- [ ] Create RDD from NYC taxi rides data
- [ ] Perform RDD transformations (e.g., map, filter)
- [ ] Demonstrate RDD actions (e.g., reduce, collect)

### 3. End-to-End Pipeline for NYC Taxi Rides
- [ ] Load and clean the dataset
- [ ] Perform data preprocessing (handle nulls, remove invalid records)
- [ ] Conduct exploratory data analysis (ride distribution by time, fare, location)
- [ ] Implement feature extraction (e.g., trip duration, distance)
- [ ] Aggregate insights (average fare by borough, peak hours, etc.)
- [ ] Optimize performance with caching, partitioning, and tuning

### 4. Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for DataFrame operations
- [ ] Write unit tests for Dataset operations
- [ ] Write unit tests for RDD operations
- [ ] Write unit tests for the pipeline
