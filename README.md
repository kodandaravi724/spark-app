# NYC Taxi Rides Data Analysis with Spark

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Apache Spark for large-scale data processing and analysis. It covers basic to advanced operations on DataFrames, Datasets, and low-level APIs like RDDs, with the aim of developing an end-to-end data pipeline to analyze NYC taxi rides data.

## Features
- Basic operations on Spark DataFrames (select, filter, groupBy, etc.)
- Demonstrations of Dataset transformations and actions
- Usage of Spark's low-level API (RDDs)
- End-to-End pipeline for processing and analyzing NYC taxi rides data
    - Data loading and cleaning
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    - Feature extraction and transformation
    - Aggregated insights and analytics
